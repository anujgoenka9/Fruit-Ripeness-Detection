# Fruit-Ripeness-Detection
This project aims to classify 6 types of fruit (apple, banana, orange, pomegranate, mango and papaya) into 3 classes of raw, ripe or rotten

## Data Collection
The model was trained on the dataset that was scraped from Google Images using selenium.

I designed a programme that searches for photos on a webpage. The img tag will be used to identify the photos, and the CSS selector Q4LuWd will be applied to each image.  It saves the image source to a list after it has been found. This pattern repeats itself until the required number of images is found. If the required number of photographs is not met, I have included a backup option in the software. 

The list of image urls is then sent to a different function that saves the image to the folder of its class

Our model will train on the following set of 18 total classes

Each class has around 110 images to it(following is an example of what the ripe apple class folder contains)

## Model Building and Training
I used transfer learning to import the MobileNetv2 model containing weights trained on imagenet dataset. To this base layer of MobileNetV2, we add our global spatial average pooling layer, a fully connected layer and a logistic layer at the end. I used ReLu activation function in all the layers except the last one which is the logistic layer, for which i used a the sigmoid activation function.

The model was trained for 5 epochs in two stages and this was the graph obtained:

Our model returned the following result:

## Deployment
The model was then deployed on raspberry pi 4. The raspbian os does not support tensorflow 2, hence I had to convert the keras model into tensorflow's frozen graph model so that I can read the model using OpenCV's DNN module.
